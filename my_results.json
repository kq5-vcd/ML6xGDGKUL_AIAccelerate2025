      "question": "In the fictional language of Tizin, basic sentences are arranged with the Verb first, followed by the direct object, followed by the subject of the sentence. I want to express my love for apples to my Tizin friend. \n\nThe word that indicates oneself is \"Pa\" is the nominative form, \"Mato\" is the accusative form, and \"Sing\" is the genitive form. \n\nThe root verb that indicates an intense like for something is \"Maktay\". When it is used in the present, it is used in it's root form, when it is used in the preterit past, it is \"Tay\", and when it is used in the imperfect past, it is \"Aktay\". It is used differently than in English, and is better translated as \"is pleasing to\", meaning that the thing doing the liking is actually the object of the sentence rather than the subject.\n\nThe word for apples is borrowed from English in Tizin, and so it is \"Apple\" is the nominative form, \"Zapple\" is the accusative form, and \"Izapple\" is the genitive form. \n\nPlease translate \"I like apples\" to Tizin.",

      "question": "You are Van Helsing, a renowned vampire hunter. A Count of Moldova, La\u021bcu IV, son of  Costea, has tasked you with investigating the village of \u0218irnea in neighboring Wallachia. The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\n\nYou travel to the village of \u0218irnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\n\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of \u0218irnea. You ask everyone the same question: \"How many vampires are living in \u0218irnea\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nHow many residents of \u0218irnea have been turned into vampires?",

      "question": "I have the Standard plan in the image below, and I just uploaded 60 equally sized files and got a message that I'm 100GB over the limit. I have 980 more files of the same size to upload. What is the average additional cost per file in dollar that goes over my current plan limit rounded to the nearest cent if I have to upgrade to the minimum possible plan to store them all? Answer with the following format: x.xx",
      "expected_answer": "0.03",
      "agent_response": "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:\n\n1.  **Determine the file size:**\n    The problem states that uploading 60 equally sized files resulted in a 100 GB overage on the Standard plan. The most direct interpretation is that the user was at their 2 TB limit, and the 60 files added 100 GB of data.\n    *   Size per file = 100 GB / 60 files = 5/3 GB/file.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total storage required:**\n    The user needs to store the files they already have (which are at the 2 TB limit) plus all the new files (60 uploaded + 980 pending).\n    *   Total number of new files = 60 + 980 = 1,040 files.\n    *   Total size of new files = 1,040 files * (5/3 GB/file) \u2248 1733.33 GB.\n    *   The Standard plan's limit is 2 TB, which is 2 * 1024 = 2048 GB.\n    *   Total storage needed = 2048 GB (current usage) + 1733.33 GB (new files) = 3781.33 GB.\n\n3.  **Determine the minimum required plan:**\n    We need to find the smallest plan that can hold 3781.33 GB.\n    *   Standard Plan: 2 TB = 2048 GB (not enough)\n    *   Plus Plan: 10 TB = 10240 GB (enough)\n    The minimum possible plan is the **Plus Plan**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the additional cost:**\n    The user must upgrade from the Standard to the Plus plan.\n    *   Standard Plan cost = $9.99/month\n    *   Plus Plan cost = $19.99/month\n    *   Additional monthly cost = $19.99 - $9.99 = $10.00.\n\n5.  **Calculate the average additional cost per file:**\n    The additional cost of $10.00 is to accommodate the 1,040 new files that are over the original plan's limit.\n    *   Average cost per file = $10.00 / 1,040 files \u2248 $0.009615...\n\n6.  **Round to the nearest cent:**\n    *   Rounding $0.009615... to the nearest cent gives $0.01.\n\n0.01",
